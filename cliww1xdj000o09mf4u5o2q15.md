Hi there! Hope you're doing well :)

I've spent the last few months documenting my experiences with running a server at home. I hope that I've been able to help others get started with doing the same, or at least put some inspiration out for exploring the topic further!

At this point, I think I've covered everything you'd need to get a server up and running with acceptable availability and security practices for personal use. As such, this seems like a good time to wrap things up for the season and take some time away from keyboard mashing about server configs.

**This hopefully won't be the end of the series though!** There are still some topics left to be explored in Season 2:

* Home Networking: setting up routers, switches, access points, and so on
    
* Setting up a UPS (uninterruptible power supply)
    
* Upgrading to a rack-mounted setup
    
* Creating a media server
    
* Minimizing power consumption
    
* ARM and alternative architectures
    

If you have any suggestions for any more topics, [let me know!](https://bencuan.me/contact) Also feel free to contact me if there are any issues with the current content- as mentioned before, I intend for this series to be living documentation that will get gradually upgraded over time.

Getting back to this will probably take a while; I'll need to spend some more time upgrading TurtleNet itself before I will have the ability and expertise to actually document the things I want to do with it. Besides, there are plenty of other fun things I want to work on now that the TurtleNet series is (mostly) in working order!

Happy homelabbing!
